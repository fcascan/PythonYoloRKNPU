Simply run the automatic installation script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fcascan/CHAP-V.git
cd CHAP-V
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Console Mode (Traditional)
```bash

sudo pip3 install Flask Flask-SocketIO eventlet

# Start web interface
sudo python3 main.py --web

# Or use the dedicated web starter
sudo python3 start_web.py
```

Then open your browser to: **http://your-device-ip:8080**

## Web Interface Features

- **Real-time Video Streaming**: See live detection results in your browser
- **Console Output**: All terminal messages displayed in web interface
- **Configuration Panel**: Change inference device, mode, and camera settings
- **Control Buttons**: Start/stop processing remotely

## Configuration

All settings live in [`config.ini`](config.ini). A subset can also be changed at runtime from the web
UI's *Configuration* panel (which writes them back to `config.ini`); the rest are file-only. The
**Web** column marks which is which.

### Inference Devices
- **RKNPU Mode**: `inference_device = RKNPU-Auto` / `RKNPU-Distributed` - Uses RKNN Lite API on the RK3588 on-chip NPU (3 cores; *Distributed* pins one camera stream per core, *Auto* uses Core 0)
- **GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL Mode**: `inference_device = GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL` - Runs the ONNX model on the Mali-G610 via OpenCV-DNN + OpenCL (numerically correct but slow; see [GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL Inference](#gpu-opencv-opencl-inference-mali-g610) below)
- **GPU-MNN Mode**: `inference_device = GPU-MNN` - Runs a dedicated `.mnn` model on the Mali-G610 via MNN + OpenCL (fp16) - the fast, numerically-correct GPU path (see [GPU-MNN Inference](#gpu-mnn-inference-mali-g610) below)
- **NPU-Hailo8 Mode**: `inference_device = NPU-Hailo8` - Runs a dedicated `.hef` model on the external **Hailo-8** (26 TOPS) M.2/PCIe accelerator via HailoRT (see [NPU-Hailo8 Inference](#npu-hailo8-inference-hailo-8) below)
- **CPU Mode**: `device = CPU` - Uses ONNX Runtime with the CPU backend

## Performance Results & Reports

Every time inference finishes —whether manually stopped via the UI/console, or automatically upon reaching `inference_timeout_minutes`— the system automatically generates performance artifacts in the `src/processing/results/` folder:

1. **CSV Log** (`<timestamp>_performance_metrics_<MODE>[_coreN]_stream<N>.csv`): Raw, frame-by-frame data (inference time, fps, CPU/GPU/NPU usage, temperatures, etc.). One file per parallel stream; RKNPU modes include the NPU core binding (`coreN`) in the name. All files of the same execution share the timestamp prefix.
2. **Text Summary** (`*_analysis.txt`): A statistical summary detailing percentiles, averages, max/min limits, and hardware metrics.
3. **PNG Graph** (`*_report.png`): Visual charts plotting inference latency, frame rates, and resource utilization across the execution timeline.

> **Hailo-8 metrics note:** in `NPU-Hailo8` mode the per-frame CSV also records the module's real chip temperature (`hailo_temp_c`) and power draw (`hailo_power_w`), self-sampled every ~2 s during inference — they are captured even in headless/SSH runs where the web monitor is not open.

> **Graph Rendering Note:** When generating `.png` reports from benchmark runs with thousands of frames, the data is downsampled to ~300 points for visualization. By default (`graph_downsample_method = worst_case`), this is a **worst-case windowed downsampling** (plotting the maximum latency/usage and minimum FPS per window) to ensure instantaneous spikes are never lost. If you prefer to visualize the true visual average without spikes, you can set `graph_downsample_method = mean` in `config.ini` or use `--graph_method mean` in the automation script.

## Automated Benchmark Script

To facilitate exhaustive testing for research and performance comparison, the project includes an automation script: `run_all_benchmarks.py`.

This script iterates autonomously over the 5 supported YOLO11 models (`n`, `s`, `m`, `l`, `x`) and the 7 inference modes (`RKNPU-Auto`, `RKNPU-Distributed`, `CPU`, `CPU-50%`, `GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL`, `GPU-MNN`, `NPU-Hailo8`), yielding 35 benchmark combinations per stream count.

**Defaults (no flags):** runs the full matrix at **both 3 and 1 instances** (70 iterations — filling both the multi-stream and single-stream comparison tables in one unattended execution) with a **15-minute timeout** per benchmark. Override with:

- `--instances` — one or more stream counts; runs the full matrix once per value. `--instances 3` or `--instances 1` for a single count, `--instances 3 1` for both (same as the default).
- `--timeout` — minutes per benchmark (default `15`).

For each iteration, the script dynamically rewrites `config.ini` (setting `max_inference_instances` and `inference_timeout_minutes`), invokes `main.py`, and waits for the timeout to conclude naturally, generating performance reports and CSV logs automatically.

### Usage

Run it as root **with the virtual-environment interpreter** (the script launches `main.py` with the same interpreter it is started with; the system Python lacks the project dependencies):

```bash
# Default: full matrix at BOTH 3 and 1 instances, 15-min timeout (fills both tables)
sudo venv/bin/python3 run_all_benchmarks.py

# Only the 3-instance sweep (or only 1-instance: --instances 1)
sudo venv/bin/python3 run_all_benchmarks.py --instances 3

# Both instance counts, explicit, with a custom 5-minute timeout
sudo venv/bin/python3 run_all_benchmarks.py --instances 3 1 --timeout 5

# Display all available arguments
venv/bin/python3 run_all_benchmarks.py --help
```

> **Estimated duration:** each iteration runs until the timeout (default 15 min) plus analysis time — a single 35-combination sweep (`--instances 3`) takes ~9 h, and the default dual (3 + 1 instances) ~17.5 h.

### Logging
The script features dual-logging. The complete output (including standard `main.py` progression) is mirrored simultaneously to the terminal console and to `run_all_benchmarks.log` in the project root to preserve historical results.

## GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL Inference (Mali-G610)

> **Mode name:** `inference_device = GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL` (the legacy value `GPU` still works and
> maps to this mode). Named explicitly because a separate, faster GPU backend (MNN) may be added
> later as its own mode — this one is the OpenCV-DNN / OpenCL path.

**This mode runs the ONNX model on the Mali-G610 via OpenCV-DNN with the OpenCL target**
(`DNN_BACKEND_OPENCV` + `DNN_TARGET_OPENCL`), decoded by the same `post_process()` as the
CPU and NPU paths. It uses the **same ONNX** as CPU mode (`PATHS.model_onnx`), so all three
processors run identical weights — no separate GPU model or conversion needed.

Observed (benchmark.mp4, `detectS2`, obj 0.5): **correct detections matching CPU/NPU to within
~2 px**, ~2.3–2.5 s/frame (~0.4 FPS). It is slow, but it is a genuine, numerically-correct
Mali-GPU data point — Mali load sits at ~70–100% during inference. The mode is kept on purpose:
it offloads inference to the GPU, leaving most of the CPU free for other work.

> **Why this mode is slow.** The bottleneck is OpenCV-DNN's OpenCL backend (`ocl4dnn`), not the
> Mali hardware: it does not fuse YOLO11's SiLU activation (so each SiLU runs as a separate,
> memory-bandwidth-bound element-wise kernel — these dominate the runtime), its fast convolution
> kernels are Intel-only and fall back to a generic kernel on Mali (no Winograd), and OpenCV
> forces fp32 on non-Intel GPUs. The net effect is that OpenCV's *own* CPU backend is ~4× faster
> than its OpenCL backend on the same graph, and ONNX Runtime on CPU (fused + multithreaded) is
> faster still.

> **Why not ncnn + Vulkan?** ncnn was the first GPU candidate but numerically mis-computes YOLO11
> on this Mali-G610: the stride-8/16 class heads collapse to 0.0 (only stride-32 fires), so

> on ONNX Runtime CPU** — proving the fault is ncnn's computation of this YOLO11 graph, not the
> Mali driver and not the model. No conversion path or ncnn version produced stable, correct
> boxes, so ncnn + Vulkan was dropped in favour of OpenCV-DNN / OpenCL.

### System dependencies (one-time setup)

GPU mode needs an OpenCL stack on top of the Python packages. On this OrangePi it is already
installed; on a fresh device set it up as follows.

**1. OpenCL ICD loader** (generic `libOpenCL.so` that apps link against):

```bash
sudo apt install ocl-icd-libopencl1
```

**2. Mali OpenCL userspace driver** — the `libmali` *valhall-g610* blob, which implements
OpenCL 3.0 for the Mali-G610. (Installed manually; it is not in the Ubuntu repos.)

```bash
# Download the g610 valhall blob (x11-wayland-gbm variant includes OpenCL) from
#   https://github.com/tsukumijima/libmali-rockchip/releases
sudo cp libmali-valhall-g610-g24p0-x11-wayland-gbm.so /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/
sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libmali-valhall-g610-g24p0-x11-wayland-gbm.so \
            /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libmali.so.1
```

**3. Register the Mali OpenCL ICD** so the loader finds the blob:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/OpenCL/vendors
echo "/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libmali-valhall-g610-g24p0-x11-wayland-gbm.so" \
  | sudo tee /etc/OpenCL/vendors/mali.icd
```

**4. OpenCV with OpenCL** — `opencv-python` from PyPI already includes the OpenCL backend
(no rebuild needed).

> Note: this is the **OpenCL** path. The old ncnn experiment used Vulkan
> (`/etc/vulkan/icd.d/`); that is no longer used by this project and is not required.

### Verify the GPU is available

```bash
venv/bin/python -c "
import cv2
print('haveOpenCL:', cv2.ocl.haveOpenCL())
cv2.ocl.setUseOpenCL(True)
d = cv2.ocl.Device_getDefault()
print('Device:', d.name(), '| vendor:', d.vendorName(), '| OpenCL', d.OpenCLVersion())
"
# Expected: haveOpenCL: True   Device: Mali-G610 r0p0 | vendor: ARM | OpenCL OpenCL 3.0 ...
```

### Observed performance

Full benchmark campaign: the retrained `threats_{N,S,M,L,X}` models (YOLO11 n/s/m/l/x) on
`benchmark.mp4`, `obj 0.5`, 15 min per combination, across the **7 inference modes** at both **1 and
3 concurrent streams** (5 × 7 × 2 = 70 runs). The snapshot below is per-stream FPS at 3 concurrent
streams — the multi-camera scenario; the complete dataset (inference time, per-core CPU/NPU/GPU/Hailo
load, temperature, power, detection rate, effective TOPS, FPS/W, annual-energy projection) lives in
the project's measurement spreadsheet and the **thesis this project is based on**, which hold the
detailed analysis.

**FPS per stream — 3 concurrent streams:**

| Model | RKNPU-Auto | RKNPU-Distributed | CPU | CPU-50% | GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL | GPU-MNN | NPU-Hailo8 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nano (n)    | 12.5 | **22.4** | 2.6 | 3.1 | 0.5  | 6.7 | 20.0 |
| Small (s)   | 8.3  | **15.8** | 1.0 | 1.1 | 0.1  | 2.9 | 17.2 |
| Medium (m)  | 3.6  | 7.7      | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.04 | 1.3 | **10.2** |
| Large (l)   | 2.9  | 6.4      | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.03 | 1.1 | 5.9 |
| X-Large (x) | 1.4  | 3.4      | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.01 | 0.5 | **3.4** |

(At **1 stream** Hailo-8 dominates every size — e.g. 36.5 FPS on Nano, 7.5 FPS on X-Large — and
RKNPU-Auto ≈ RKNPU-Distributed; those figures are in the spreadsheet.)

**Key findings**

- **RKNPU-Distributed ≈ 1.8× RKNPU-Auto for multi-stream:** Auto pins all streams to NPU **core 0**
  (which saturates 71 % → 96 % as the model grows), while Distributed pins one stream per core,
  spreading load evenly across **all three** (~45 % → ~85 % each). With a *single* stream there is
  nothing to distribute, so Auto ≈ Distributed (both use core 0 only).
- **Hailo-8 wins the larger models** (Medium/X-Large) and dominates all sizes at 1 stream, drawing
  only **~0.9 W** of module power — yet it reads ~60–90 % occupancy because the single-process,
  GIL-bound host pipeline cannot keep its queue full: it is **host-bound, not compute-bound** (real
  effective throughput is a small fraction of its 26-TOPS peak).
- **GPU-MNN is ~14–18× faster than GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL** and offloads the CPU; GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL is
  kept only as a correctness baseline (pathologically slow). See
  [GPU-MNN Inference](#gpu-mnn-inference-mali-g610). The first GPU-MNN run adds a one-time ~50 s
  OpenCL kernel auto-tuning.
- **CPU-50%** matches or slightly beats full CPU at 1 stream (4 fast A76 threads vs 8 mixed cores)
  while leaving the A55 cluster free; under 3 streams it trades throughput for headroom.
- All modes produce correct, matching detections.

## CPU-50% mode (`inference_device = CPU-50%`)

CPU-50% is **plain CPU inference, just capped so it does not saturate the whole CPU** — the device
stays usable for other things while it runs. It is identical to CPU mode except the ONNX Runtime
session is limited to `cpu50_threads` (default **4**) threads, pinned to the **A76 big cores**
(`cpu50_affinity = 4,5,6,7`), so the **A55 little cores stay free** for the OS/desktop. Same
`detectS2.onnx` — no extra model.

Measured on benchmark.mp4: **~340 ms/frame (~3 FPS)**, whole-device CPU **~48 %** (A76 ~85–88 %,
A55 ~9 %) — versus full CPU mode which hits ~127 ms/frame but pins all 8 cores at 100 %. The trade
is throughput for headroom; lower `cpu50_threads` (e.g. `2–3`) leaves even more CPU free.

> This bounds *core placement and count* (the A55 cores stay free), not *utilization* — the A76
> cluster can still run near 100 % while inferring. The point is the device as a whole is not
> saturated and stays responsive.
>
> A true CPU+GPU split for one stream was evaluated and dropped: with the current GPU ~19× slower
> than the CPU, it cannot beat CPU-alone (its frames arrive stale). A genuinely useful CPU+GPU mode
> would first require a faster GPU backend (e.g. MNN) — tracked separately.

Enable it by selecting **CPU-50%** in the web UI's *Inference Device* dropdown (or `inference_device =
CPU-50%`); tune the cap with `cpu50_threads` and `cpu50_affinity` — see [Configuration](#configuration).

## GPU-MNN Inference (Mali-G610)

> **Mode name:** `inference_device = GPU-MNN`. The fast, numerically-correct GPU path: it runs a
> dedicated `.mnn` model on the Mali-G610 via **MNN** (Alibaba) with the **OpenCL** backend
> (operator fusion + fp16 + kernel auto-tuning).

Unlike GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL (correct but ~2.4 s/frame), MNN's OpenCL backend computes the same YOLO11
graph **correctly and ~18× faster** (~140 ms/frame at fp16). Verified against the CPU path on
benchmark.mp4: every output head — including the stride-8/16 class heads that ncnn+Vulkan corrupted —
matches CPU at **cosine ≥ 0.9993 (fp16)** / **≥ 0.9999 (fp32)**, and per-frame detections match CPU.

**Precision is a runtime knob** (one `.mnn` file serves both fp16 and fp32): enable with
`inference_device = GPU-MNN` and set `mnn_precision` (default `low` = fp16) / `mnn_backend` — see
[Configuration](#configuration).

### Model
GPU-MNN uses its own model (`PATHS.model_mnn`, default `assets/models/detectS2.mnn`), converted from
the same ONNX in Google Colab. Convert to a plain fp32 `.mnn` (no `--fp16`) — the compute precision is
chosen at runtime via `mnn_precision`:

```bash
mnnconvert -f ONNX --modelFile detectS2.onnx --MNNModel detectS2.mnn --bizCode biz
```

### System dependencies (one-time setup)
The PyPI `mnn` wheel is **CPU-only** (no OpenCL backend), so MNN must be **built from source**. Just as
important on the RK3588: recent MNN (≥ 3.x) enables the Arm **SME2** backend + **KleidiAI** microkernels
**by default** for arm64 — but the RK3588 (Cortex-A76/A55) has **no SME2/SVE2/i8mm**, and MNN's SME2 path
is **not gated by CPU detection**, so a default build executes SME2 instructions (`smstart`/`fmopa`/`rdsvl`)
on a CPU that lacks them and dies with **`illegal hardware instruction` (SIGILL)** the moment a GPU-MNN
session is created. The build therefore **must** pass `-DMNN_SME2=OFF -DMNN_KLEIDIAI=OFF`.

Use the provided script — it clones + patches + builds + installs into the project venv, provisions the
OpenCL symlink, and verifies the result has no SME2 code:

```bash
./setup.sh                        # first: system deps + venv + RKNPU
./installation/build_mnn_opencl.sh   # then: MNN with OpenCL (SME2/KleidiAI OFF) into ./venv
```

# In build_deps.py, append to the base extra_opts line:  -DMNN_SME2=OFF -DMNN_KLEIDIAI=OFF
# (MNN_ARM82=OFF is already handled by build_deps.py; gcc-15 ICEs on the ARM82 fp16 backend.)

```

## NPU-Hailo8 Inference (Hailo-8)

> **Mode name:** `inference_device = NPU-Hailo8`. Runs a dedicated `.hef` model on the external
> **Hailo-8** (26 TOPS) accelerator on the M.2/PCIe slot, via **HailoRT** — a separate dedicated NPU,
> independent of the RK3588's on-chip RKNPU.

It uses the **same Rockchip 9-head ONNX** as the other modes, compiled to a `.hef` **without on-chip
NMS (raw FPN)**, so the existing `post_process()` decodes it unchanged. Model: `PATHS.model_hailo8`
(point it at your `<model>.hef`, e.g. `assets/models/<model>.hef`). Input is fed as **NHWC uint8**
(normalization baked into the HEF); outputs are transposed to NCHW and re-grouped to the per-scale
`[box, cls, sum]` layout.

**Multi-stream:** the Hailo-8 is a *single* accelerator (not 3 cores like the RKNPU). Up to 3 camera
streams share one VDevice via HailoRT's round-robin scheduler (time-shared), so there is **no
Auto/Distributed split** for this mode.

### Model conversion (ONNX → HEF)
The `.hef` is produced **off-device** with the Hailo **Dataflow Compiler** (DFC) from the same
Rockchip 9-head ONNX as the other modes — keep the 9 output heads, no on-chip NMS. The pipeline is
**parse** (ONNX → `.har`) → **optimize** (INT8 calibration with ~100–300 representative images) →
**compile** (`performance_param(compiler_optimization_level=max)`) → `.hef`; then place your
`<model>.hef` in `assets/models/` and point `PATHS.model_hailo8` at it.

**Recommended:** run the DFC inside Hailo's **AI Software Suite Docker** on an x86_64 machine (Linux,
or Windows via Docker Desktop, ≥16 GB RAM). That image bundles **`hailo_dataflow_compiler-3.34.0`**,
which version-matches HailoRT 4.24.0 for Hailo-8. See the *Conversion to Hailo HEF* section of the
conversion notebook for the full steps.

> ⚠️ **A free, time-limited Google Colab session cannot finish the conversion.** Parse/optimize run,
> but the final compile times out — YOLO11's C2PSA attention block forces a multi-context split whose
> per-context allocator watchdog (~1h) Colab's 2-core CPU can't beat ("Resolver didn't find possible
> solution / Watchdog expired"), or the session disconnects first (true even for a YOLO11n nano). Use
> Colab only to validate the pipeline; build the real `.hef` in the Docker image on a multi-core x86
> machine. (`3.33.1` from the Developer Zone → **Archive** also works; source page:
> <https://hailo.ai/developer-zone/software-downloads/?product=ai_accelerators&device=hailo_8_8l>.)

> ⚠️ **Match the DFC to the runtime.** For **Hailo-8 + HailoRT 4.24.0** (this device) use **DFC 3.34.0 or
> 3.33.1** — both pin `tensorflow==2.18.0` so they install on Colab's Python 3.12, and both emit a HEF
> that HailoRT 4.24.0 can load. The *main* download page's **DFC 5.3.0 targets Hailo-10H**; its HEF will
> **not load** on HailoRT 4.24.0, so use 5.3.0 only to dry-run the pipeline. The notebook's setup cell
> auto-prefers a 3.x wheel.
>
> _Colab note:_ a 3.x DFC pins `pyparsing==2.4.7`, but it imports TensorFlow whose `httplib2` needs
> `pyparsing>=3.1`; the notebook upgrades it (otherwise `hailo parser` crashes with `AttributeError:
> ... 'set_name'`).

### Runtime install (one-time, on the device)
The Hailo-8 needs the HailoRT stack (PCIe driver + runtime + pyhailort), matching the **HailoRT 4.24.0**
used here (account-gated downloads from the Hailo Developer Zone):

```bash
sudo apt install -y dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo dpkg -i hailort-pcie-driver_4.24.0_all.deb     # DKMS builds the kernel module
sudo modprobe hailo_pci                              # creates /dev/hailo0 (no reboot needed)
sudo dpkg -i hailort_4.24.0_arm64.deb                # hailortcli + libhailort
venv/bin/pip install hailort-4.24.0-cp312-cp312-linux_aarch64.whl
hailortcli fw-control identify                       # verify the Hailo-8 is detected
```

### System Monitor
The web System Monitor includes a **Hailo-8** card, populated while NPU-Hailo8 inference runs:

- **Load** — a device-occupancy **busy-fraction %** (device inference time ÷ wall-time). HailoRT 4.24 exposes
  no Python utilization counter (`query_performance_stats`/`nnc_utilization` are absent); the only official
  figure is `hailortcli monitor`'s scheduler `Utilization %`, which tracks this busy-fraction. It reads well
  below 100 % even with 3 streams: the single-process, GIL-bound host pipeline can't keep the Hailo's queue
  full, so the accelerator is **host-bound, not compute-bound** (hence low power and FPS that fall with model
  size). Treat this as a software occupancy proxy — it is not the same kind of number as the RKNPU/GPU sysfs loads.
- **Latency** — mean device inference time per frame (ms); **FPS** — achieved throughput. These are the most
  meaningful cross-mode comparison metrics here.
- **Power** — real on-board **average** watts (whole module, via the M.2 overcurrent sensor), measured
  continuously and averaged.
- **Temp** — chip temperature (°C).

## Troubleshooting

- **No cameras / a camera missing**: Run `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`. Each USB webcam exposes several `/dev/video*` nodes but only the capture-capable one is used; cameras are enumerated by capability and numbered by USB port (so 3 cams are not necessarily nodes 0/1/2)
- **Permission denied**: Use `sudo` to run this program
- **Web interface not accessible**: Check firewall settings and use correct IP
- **Video stream not loading**: Ensure processing is started and frames are available
- **GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL falling back to CPU**: Check the OpenCL stack — `cv2.ocl.haveOpenCL()` must be `True` and `/etc/OpenCL/vendors/mali.icd` must point to the libmali blob (see [GPU-OpenCV-OpenCL Inference](#gpu-opencv-opencl-inference-mali-g610) above)

## Model Compatibility
Ensure the RKNN model is compatible with your Rockchip device and matches the input size (640, 640).

## Benchmark Videos
The benchmark clips are **public YouTube surveillance videos**, chosen deliberately: they are publicly
available, show a **clear real-weapon situation in which nobody is harmed** (so the footage is not
graphic or sensitive), and **nobody is identifiable** (no privacy concerns). Each is security-camera
footage of two full-body subjects in a room with a typical, everyday setup where such incidents can
occur — a realistic fit for evaluating weapon detection.
